# GraphGitHubRepo

Creates a map of a git repository. To achieve this there are two scripts available:

* shell script 
* python script

The first one prepares the necessary data with the help of `git` commands. The python script then visualizes the data previously collected with the help of `graphviz`. Requieres `graphviz` module to be installed.
